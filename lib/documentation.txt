this is my portfolio website documentation
how to deal with this code to add new thing ?

1)to add animated photos in home screen ?first drag and drop photo inside assets/images folder
 then add AnimatedPhoto object inside animatedPhotoList in model/animated_photos_model

2)to add certificate to my certificates ? add CertificateModel object to certificates list in model/certificate_model

3)to add new link to your website first add website logo image to assets/images folder
then add new object inside links list in models/link_model file

4)stay tuned we are not finished yet

/*very important note : in any object that need index variable let the value as it is
++currentIndex otherwise the app may crush or make unexpected behavior*/
